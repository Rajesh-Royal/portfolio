						I find the right tech stack for your project, scale your team and

					</p>
					<p className="mt-4 mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
						I love working with startups and established businesses to find the
						right tech stack, be it a single new feature or a whole rebuild of
						your current product. I can help you find the perfect developers for
						your project and scale up as your business grows.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-4 mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
						When it comes to application development, I&apos;ve seen it all.
						From building highly customised enterprise software stacks on the
						latest open source frameworks to reducing costs and improving user
						experience with cloud-based solutions.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-4 mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
						I offer consulting services for companies and agencies that strive

						bugs and defects in a system, recommending best practices for
						scalability and performance.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-4 mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
						Nobody likes software projects to fail. But there are some common
						mistakes that developers make, that can cause software projects to
						underperform or even crash. And these issues aren&apos;t always the
						fault of a developer, but sometimes the code itself is just bad or
						outdated. I&apos;ve been auditing the code of projects for
						compliance and performance for years and enjoy working with
						companies of all sizes to help them scale.

					<p className="mt-4 mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
						As an accessibility auditor, I audit existing websites and apps for
