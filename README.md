This is my portfolio website, proudly built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). The content is managed through [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) and accessed via GraphQL endpoints using [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/).

Previously I built my website using WordPress but decided to move over to Next.js due to their major improvements and learning purpose that make it my first choice, not only for applications, but also for websites now.
